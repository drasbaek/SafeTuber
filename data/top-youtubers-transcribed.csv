You just not take  full damage? Yeah, so if you have a lightsaber, you can't double jump unless  you're using the lightsaber. But if you zoom in, let's say I just use my forces  on this. Whoa, destroy objects! Oh my gosh, I have got to try and hit someone  with these new abilities. Now, obviously, I got pretty damn lucky at the start of  this game  to get one of the Star Wars characters  literally spawning in front of me,  but throughout the game, you'll see them on your map  spawning in, and you've gotta be the first one  to go up to them to get the lightsaber,  to get the abilities to it is definitely a bit of a rush."", 'A full horseman of what is this epic?

I've never seen this before probably almost impossible to actually put off again  But if you could it could be potentially overpowered  This person used the auto locking pistol to hit the all which then auto locked on to the enemy  But look the the rock was gonna fly off that way,  but maybe because it was hit by the auto-locking bullets,  it automatically locked onto the enemy!

Oh my gosh I don't know why this is  bringing back so much nostalgia  This isn't even that old who remembers this old menu selection. Oh my gosh  Memories using the force pull to catch a fleeing enemy  I've not seen like too many crazy force plays yet. Not easy to pull it off well and other people have got weapons  Pulling towards you  pull it off well when other people have got weapons."", ""Whichever portal or rift get you go into to learn  Different Star Wars forces are the forces that you're locked into for the rest of the game  So you may not want to rush straight into it.

Of course, the blue one is Anakin's Force..."", ""I don't know why but Fortnite seems to just have random buildings around the map filled  with canister explosions."", ""So let's see how you go from trash to meteor."", ""Look at this, Star Wars characters have arrived in the item shop,  there's even a mini battle pass!

The specific quests and challenges that  will unlock points that then you can use to buy things in the battle pass and  even a sift infiltrator glider that can only be gotten by collecting three  Sith holograms. But we're gonna go ahead and upgrade right now. Ooh, we've got a self-asskin  straightaway and there's a button here that says buy rewards so I'm just gonna go ahead and unlock  everything. This is only possible thanks to all of you guys that use code ALIAs so that I can spend all of these V-Bucks  and get literally every single one of these things  unlocked for you guys."", ""Most people thought it doesn't even know it exists.

Oh my goodness, we have got the ultimate Sith party going on here.', ""Hopefully we can get there quick enough.  It's not too far."", ""Ahh, that's even worth it I'm honest.  Realize it destroying the vault floors a quick way to get all the gold."", 'Please Evan, can we get more backlings like Merry Munchkin?  That is actually so cool to you fair.', ""Oh really?  Oh.  Oh my.  What?  That is a Stormtrooper disguised as a  two-group character if I've ever seen you before you missed every bullet!  The icy slide is underrated alright show me why it is because I never use this thing."", ""They're only gonna get better and better.  Star Wars 1's are probably the best so far."", ""If you're into collecting rare things, this is rare.  Well fair play, one of them was in the item shop."", 'The idea of having icy feet as soon as I slide is probably one of the most annoying things in the world.', 'This is the biggest Star Wars update ever, including its open battle pass with 3 rewards,  brand new force abilities, mythic weapons and tons more.', 'This is launching rocks at me!  Oh, hello.  Thea! All the fatback did kind of nothing to him, but...', ""I'm so excited to get this one and of course it's going to be learned from dark mool, who  else can it be learned by?

I've got to definitely rate this one up there with the Rift Forces returning the new Star Wars  abilities the light sabers I think this is the best Star Wars collab in Fortnite  we've had and we've had lots of course but this one's just been done so well  ignore the fact that every time I've used one of the abilities it has got me  killed actually think these abilities will be a lot better  in build mode, but you can destroy builds  and do a lot more with it."", ""They're getting better and better.  Like a lot of people said mine was the most accurate when it came out."", ""There's no way he survives this, right?  How is he still on the island?  Oh my goodness, he actually survived."", 'I think by far my favourite thing of these updates is just the mini battle pass.', ""I'm very interested to see how this works.

Wait, if you just pick up the lightsaber,  you don't get the ability."", ""You've got three rewards, which you can see in the top layer here."", ""Oh my.  That is incredibly unlucky.

I'm just seeing all these incredible Star Wars skins  in game is awesome."", ""My first experience using the Force ability in Fortnite.  Alright, he's popped on."", 'Oh, there we go.  There is one on the map.', ""Stormtroopers, Anakin and Darth Vader.  All partying together.  Ah, the lightsabers are here, but you still use me, right?  Right?  I'll be honest, I think I'd probably still pick a kinetic blade up over the lightsaber  but the new forces, I don't know which one would you guys pick. Oh you can only choose one and the  other will never happen again so you can keep them as a mythic and they'll come back periodically  or they turn into a pickaxe and you can use them forever I mean for me that's an easy answer."", ""Paul's got his own locker, he need a few of these skins before, new Star Wars skins, or one  of them is there to be fair."", ""We're now flying trash meets you I guess.
