## Description
This repository forms the solution to self-chosen assignment 5 by Anton Drasbæk Schiønning (202008161) in the course "Language Analytics" at Aarhus University. <br>

The "SafeTubers" project sets out to quantify the amount of toxic speech used by the top YouTubers in the United States. <br> 

Based on a ranking of the most popular YouTube channels by [HypeAuditor](https://hypeauditor.com/top-youtube/), we have identified and analyzed 200 of the most watched YouTube channels in the United States that are not music artists (e.g. Justin Bieber) or main stream company channels (e.g. Netflix). That is, this project focuses on which content creators on YouTube that produce the most toxic content in terms of their utterances. <br>

The motivation behind this project is to provide a tool which may bridge the generational gap in understanding internet culture. Whereas children spend many hours consuming content on YouTube, it may be a cumbersome task for parents to assess which content creators are child-friendly and who are not. "Safetubers" analysis of 200 channels, as well as a tool for analyzing any other provided channel, can help guide parents in this tough process.
