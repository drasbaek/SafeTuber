Most, but not all channels can be analyzed using the SafeTuber pipeline. <br>

In order for an analysis using `single_classify.py` to be possible, a channel must meet these five criteria:
* Have some videos that are longer than 2 minutes and a maximum of 30 minutes within their last 30 videos.
* Have some videos that are not age restricted nor limited by georestrictions.
* Videos that qualify must produce verbal content, not just visual elements.
* Primary language must be English.
* Not be exclusively a YouTube Shorts channel.
