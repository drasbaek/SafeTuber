Most, but not all channels can be analyzed using the SafeTuber pipeline. <br>

In order for an analysis using `single_classify.py` to be possible, a channel must meet these five criteria:
  1. Have some videos that are longer than 2 minutes and a maximum of 30 minutes within their last 30 videos.
  2. Have some videos that are not age restricted nor limited by georestrictions.
  3. Videos that qualify must produce verbal content, not just visual elements.
  4. Primary language must be English.
  5. Not be exclusively a YouTube Shorts channel.
