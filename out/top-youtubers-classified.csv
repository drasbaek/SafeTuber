They didn't eat that much in the morning,  so hopefully they'll have that extra motivation  to participate."", ""Being impressed by the cognitive abilities of a chimpanzee isn't just good for them."", ""There's not a complete hesitation  to pick up things on actual feces,  but the reactions that the monkeys give when they do so  is just so clearly different from when they,  you know, are picking things off the ground  or off the control items that we have here."", ""And now he's washing it in the water. Yeah. Is it clean enough? Oh, still got a roll."", ""Is it safe?  Let's see.  Don't hold it up.

In fact, you know, I only saw a few trials here,  but as soon as the peanut or the monkey chow  on the feces is picked up and they realize that the  feces is coming with it. It's a sticky substance and that  was when the revulsion got larger. It almost seemed  that they might be absent mindily going I don't care."", 'You said it smelled fishy, so in here,  you probably have parts of seaweed.', 'Oh, really?

Like on the auction website, we did see that there were,  there were some x-rays and the x-rays are cool  and they make it feel really official,  but all we really know by seeing those x-rays  is that the accessories are in fact in the box.', 'And so really it comes down to two main differences  between the two.', ""We plugged them in overnight,  we came back in the morning and it still didn't turn on,  but when we replaced the brick and not the cable,  it actually started to charge."", ""But it's funny, this angle always feels weird  because most people buying this phone  have never, they haven't come weird because most people buying this phone have never,  they haven't come from a $1,200 phone."", 'And I want to go over everything that I learned because we now have gotten the iPhone to turn  on and I am convinced that it is an unopened original.', ""And I kinda like that too.

No, I'm confused."", ""I want these kills, but I have another mission. So we still got gamers in this lobby.

No, he's not.  Hit.  All right."", ""All right, he's slightly more durability on it.  Haven't found any more thunder spheres either."", 'I wonder if that guy eliminated  was the 200 meter snipe dude.', ""Oh! We got it done!  Let's go!  All five mythics!  We're talking 20 bomb!

There was a bunch of fun candies."", 'Oh my gosh.  Oh, oh, I love the flavor, but then it attacks my tongue.', ""This tip is too cute. Also what I love with the pink detail is if your cactus body looks really  good but the top got a little messed up when you were going away you can cover it with a little  dollop but now we will know. I've got a fresh cupcake, we're using the same tip, but I've moved it to a new piping bag  with just some white buttercream icing,  and we're gonna make little daisies."", ""Moving on to the next tip,  we're gonna try the pink on pink color  with this little design."", 'So far those have been the trickiest petals for me,  but these petals are a little thicker, wider at the base  and they go narrow at the top, similar to that tip,  but a lot easier to work with.', ""I'm a big fan of all of them.

Oh my goodness.  Perfect.  I do to sugar.  Ice, ice, ice, ice, ice, so much ice.', ""Next candy that we're gonna try  are roomier old fashioned hard candies."", ""So it's the perfect time to pipe some flowers.

Okay, here's the next tip that we're gonna try. It kind of  looks like a sun. I don't know what to expect out of this one,  but I did the same thing."", 'I got distracted. The most beautiful one in my opinion was the most trickiest one. Had the  largest petals and the petal design  is a little thinner and longer,  so they kind of flop around the most.', 'My favorite cotton candy flavor is today if I had to decide.', ""And as you can see, this one has a really clean design  on top, and when you're piping,  and if you ever get this little tip,  kind of looks like a Hershey's kiss  or like the tip of a meringue,  wipe the Russian tip,  and then you'll get that nice clean design again."", ""It's right down here.  I'm gonna pick it up.  Really, it was just coming out in little pockets."", ""Let me know in the comments down below if there are any other musical songs that you'd like to see us cover."", ""And we're just going to put as many as you'd like all the way around."", ""Oh whoa whoa.

It's starting."", ""I'm going to show you one of pizza parchment paper before we start piping onto the cupcake."", ""Oh, it tastes great, it has great flavor,  has a little bit of tartness, it's very sweet,  piz, cotton candy, the next candy  that we're gonna test are runs,  and not just all the runs from the package,  but my favorite banana."", ""You're gonna put this on the counter.  Then you're gonna take the first color and this will be the color that will be on the outside of the flower."", ""Like this. We'll just do a little outline. Then you're gonna take your second color. I'm using  yellow and we're gonna pipe a strip in the middle. You want to be generous. The thicker the better I  kind of do circles. This is gonna be the center of the flowers color. Now you're gonna take this end  and you're gonna kind of roll it over like you would roll a roll cake."", ""We'll add a little bit more.  And we're gonna do orange."", ""Okay, we've done it.  Just took a little warm up,  and now we've got these cute little cactuses."", 'Oh, and it tears so pretty.  It just smells like blue raspberry.', ""We've set the scene.  I've iced little green frosting over the top  and sprinkled a little bit of crushed graham cracker  on the top to give it a little bit of desert vibe."", 'It turned out so cute.  The tip for this tip is keep the petal short, short, short.', ""Okay, so I made another one and they're a little bit taller  and I wanted you guys to see both."", ""It made a perfect cotton candy, you guys.  Let's taste it to see if it kept the flavor."", ""I'm gonna make a Frankenstein rainbow flower  because rainbow is my sister's favorite color."", ""Ooh, it's a flavor roller coaster.  That's what you are."", ""Let's go pack up Mike.  The littlest lady ordered the biggest dress."", 'Warning, warning, warning, polarizing opinion.  I love licorice.  We tried to make licorice cotton candy  with like a gummy one.', 'Cause I saved that for the dress.  The dress is going up for it.', ""We have found some amazing tips today, purple on the outside petals but it's really faint and it looks gorgeous. We  have found some amazing tips today but let's try one more and let's make a  tri color. Tri-color buttercream icing design. I'm going to show you how to make  a tri color frosting bag. It's super similar to what we did before. We aren't  gonna use as much icing. It's gonna be a little bit thinner than when we just do  two colors. My rectangle is almost a square."", ""So it's like a little secret surprise.  And then when you get your cotton candy and you take a bite,  then it will start popping."", ""So I'm glad that we're doing this.  The tip that I'm gonna use is actually one of my favorites  from last time we filmed this."", ""And also, let me know what other baking videos  you'd like to see,  because I'd like to make it happen."", ""Okay, here we go.  Mm.  It lost a little bit of the tartness  and it's not as fun."", 'It looks like an intricate little star  and the colors are white and purple.', ""Turn this on and see if it'll cotton candy.  Oh, something's coming out."", ""So I'm coming, so I never know from what it seems."", 'Oh, you guys, all of these tips, so much fun.', ""All right, I'm just gonna toss these in a little baggie  and crush them up."", 'Most of them are floral.  The reason I love these is it makes piping  intricate flowers really easy.', ""Ah, it's just like a chunky four petal flower.  Oh, and the sides kind of look like just a classic star tip."", ""Tons of colors.  I'll pick a new tip.  I don't even know what it's gonna look like."", '', 'Woo hoo.  This was only four ring pops.

Here's to jogbreakers, let's try it."", ""Hey guys, it's real.  Welcome back to my channel.  I have got a commercial grade cotton candy machine."", ""And then you're gonna continue  with the next color at the bottom. So you go top to bottom and the bottom to top. We've got a  pastel rainbow for spring. All right, now this is a little different. You don't  need to roll over the top to meet the bottom. So what we're gonna do is just  roll into a log. Let's cut off the end, place it into a piping bag. Oh yeah."", 'All right, that does it for a trying more Russian piping tips.', ""We've got pop rocks.  We're gonna throw that in there  see if that's gonna cotton candy."", ""I'm so excited about these.  I have been wanting to try these in this machine  for a really long time,  and you guys suggested that I try it. So we go I've got the flavor cherry let's take a look on the back  see the ingredients first ingredient is sugar second ingredient is milk I didn't  know that there was milk in here but you guys there's a little bit of lactose  pop rocks are already kind of crushed up so I think I'm just gonna pour them  right into here just for the MEMS, I just gotta look."", ""Okay, it's smelling good.  Oh, now it's smelling burnt.  It looks like it just heated up  and it's just kind  of shooting out the sides and it's not creating any floss. No cotton candy sugary floss. This candy  shot out the sides a little bit. You can see some color around the rim and then it burnt. This is a  similar result to Smarties. When I crushed up Smarties and threw it in there, I thought it was  going to be a lot of sugar and make good floss, but it just burnt and disappeared."", ""We've done it. It's beautiful. Hey guys, it's Ro. Welcome back to my channel. Today we're  gonna be playing with some Russian piping tips. It's almost been four years since we did this  on my channel the very first time. This is like the four year anniversary and spring is sprung."", ""And then this one, happy accident.  Got a little purple on the outside petals,  but it's really faint and it looks gorgeous."", ""I can put it to it too.  There's so much."", 'If you like blue raspberry, this may be your new favorite cotton candy.', ""This is too, it cotton candy twice.  I have it in my eyebrow and I don't mind."", ""Okay, wait, wait, I'll just do this.  Okay, okay.  Technically, Pop Rocks did make some floss."", ""Don't worry about what he's doing over here.  All right, I'm just gonna,  even though this does look very natural."", ""And it's okay if you get the icing in there."", 'Let me know which one was your favorite.  We tried a bunch of them today,  so let me know in the comments below.', 'If the buttercream got too hot,  if it was sitting out a little too long,  it would just get a little bit more floppy.', ""Okay, this is not fake.  I've already just setting up, I'm already,  I'm already covered. You take a beautiful gown and you get down and dirty and you feel the feels."", ""It didn't work very well.  So I found these, these are like hard candy."", ""Okay, now there's smoke coming out of there again.  It did spew out a few floss of cotton candy."", ""I would say it's the most sensitive to buttercream,  even the temperature."", ""And it is like life's kicked you down.  Yes.  The drama of feeling like, but the tigers come."", ""Like you're seeing the tigers around you.  Did you guys get the tigers?  Oh, yeah."", ""Can't wait to try it.
